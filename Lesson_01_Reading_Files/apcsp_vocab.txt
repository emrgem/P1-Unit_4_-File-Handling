Summary table:A table of aggregate information about a dataset (e.g., the average, sum, count of some values).
Filter:tool/technique using dynamic parameters for reducing a data set to viewing only similar items in a row or column.
Aggregation:A computation in which rows from a data set are grouped together and used to compute a single value of more significant meaning or measurement. Common aggregations include: Average, Count, Sum, Max, Median, etc.
Binary question:a question where there are only two possible answers
Protocol:A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices.
ASCIII:The universally recognized raw text format that any computer can understand

Higher lower:__________ level protocols use _______ levels without needing to understand precisely how they work. (space between each term)

Creative Commons:one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created.
High Level Programming Language:A programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages. Examples: JavaScript, Java, FORTRAN
Low Level Programming Language:A programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language.
Fault tolerant network:The ability to route around broken servers on the internet.
Global Variable:A variable whose scope is "global" to the program, it can be used and updated by any part of the code. Its global scope is typically derived from the variable being declared (created) outside of any function, object, or method.
If Statement:The common programming structure that implements "conditional statements".
Local Variable:A variable with local scope is one that can only be seen, used and updated by code within the same scope. Typically this means the variable was declared (created) inside a function; includes function parameter variables.
Callback function:a function specified as part of an event listener; it is written by the programmer but called by the system as the result of an event trigger.
Event:An action that causes something to happen.
User Interface:The visual elements of an program through which a user controls or communications the application. Often abbreviated UI.
Data Type:(ex: Number, Boolean, or String) a value's property that dictates how the computer will interpret it. For example 7+5 is interpreted differently from "7"+"5"
Expression:Any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
Variable:A placeholder for a piece of information that can change.
Debugging:Finding and fixing problems in your algorithm or program.
Conditionals:statements that run under only certain conditions
Selection:A generic term for a type of programming statement (usually an if-statement) that uses a Boolean condition to determine, or select, whether or not to run a certain block of statements.
Concatenate:to link together or join. Typically used when joining together text Strings in programming (e.g. "Hello, "+name)
